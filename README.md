# knight_tour
Ruby implementation of the Knight's tour chess problem.

## Overview
Knight's tour refers to a sequence of moves that a knight can make on a chessboard such that, starting from a given position, it can reach any possible square, visiting every cell exactly once.

The knight's tour problem is the mathematical problem of finding a knight's tour, given the starting and ending position of the path.
